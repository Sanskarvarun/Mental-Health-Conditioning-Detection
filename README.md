## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis model capable of accurately discerning depressive sentiments expressed within Reddit posts. By training a deep learning model on a diverse dataset of Reddit posts, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying posts into depressive and non-depressive categories, thereby providing valuable insights into mental health discourse on Reddit.

## Data
The dataset comprises Reddit posts labeled with binary categories indicating depressive (1) and non-depressive (0) sentiments. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, clean text data, and tokenize text into numerical representations suitable for model training. The inclusion of both depressive and non-depressive posts enables a comprehensive analysis of sentiment trends within online communities.

## Methodology
The methodology involves data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. Text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering to prepare it for model training. A deep learning model architecture, including an embedding layer and LSTM network, is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Flow of Work
The project follows a structured flow of work, encompassing data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. Each step is meticulously executed to ensure clarity, coherence, and reproducibility throughout the process. The flow of work is documented to facilitate transparency and enable others to replicate and build upon the project.

## Results
The sentiment analysis model achieves impressive performance metrics, including high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values, indicating its efficacy in classifying depressive sentiments within Reddit posts. The results underscore the potential of data-driven approaches to inform mental health interventions and support strategies, fostering a more empathetic and inclusive online environment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project represents a significant contribution to mental health sentiment analysis using Reddit posts. By leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques, the project offers valuable insights into online mental health discourse, empowering stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers with actionable insights to inform evidence-based interventions and support strategies.
